  3. Download the source and import the project
  4. Now you can run the project

### For Linux
``` bash
# Build environment preparation   
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    qmake6 \
    qt6-base-dev \
    qt6-multimedia-dev \
    qt6-serialport-dev \
    qt6-svg-dev \
    libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

```bash
# Setup the dialout permission for Serial port
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Setup the hidraw permission
echo 'KERNEL== "hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-openterface.rules 
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

``` bash
# Get the source
git clone https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_QT.git
cd Openterface_QT
mkdir build
cd build
qmake6 ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

``` bash
# Run
./openterfaceQT
```

``` bash
# If you can't control the mouse and keyboard (with high probability that did not correctly recognize the serial port)

# solution
sudo apt remove brltty
# after run this plug out the openterface and pulg in again
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
# if you can list the usb the serial port correctly recognized
# Then we need give the permissions to user for control serial port you can do this:
sudo ./openterfaceQT
# or 
sudo usermod -a -G dialout <your_username>
sudo reboot
# back to the build floder
./openterfaceQT

```
